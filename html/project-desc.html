                                    <h3>Topic</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>According to statistics in the last 3 years in Vietnam from the Ministry of Public Security, on average each year more than 100 children in our country go missing. Child kidnapping is increasing day by day, criminals are gradually becoming inhumane. They kidnap children to illegally trade abroad, and even cut off children's parts to trade on the black market at high value. Children's subjectivity and adults' lack of concern are harmful causes that lead to the increasingly serious situation of child kidnapping. Taking advantage of the innocence and trustworthiness of children, criminals have been lured and acted cruelly without mercy. In the movie Hope (2013), the fear of child abduction has caused extremely serious psychological ghosting for the main character's child. With the law in the film's timeline, under the excuse of being drunk, the criminal's mind is not clear, the criminal can easily be forgiven with a mild punishment compared to the injuries suffered by the victim.  </br>
                                        <br>Revolving around the topic of child kidnapping, we created a meaningful game to convey a message to users, to be alert about child kidnapping. The game leans towards the genre with a bit of adventure, and a bit of horror in the plot. The game's plot is inspired by the movie IT - an extremely hot horror movie in 2017. In essence, it is essentially a hibernating monster that comes to life every 27 years and tries to lure children to eat. The game is not only for entertainment, but our team also wants to convey many human messages in the game's plot. The reason I chose a horror game is actually very special, according to a hypothesis we learn that people today are motivated by a balance of two needs: the need to balance the level of stimulation and reason. humanism. There is another theory that humans are motivated by innate biological instincts and reflexes, also known as Instinct Theory. The members of our team wanted to combine all of the above factors and ask one question: What if the strongest motivation of humans is fear, especially fear of death. This will further deepen the message we want to convey to players through the game. Because when creating a high level of stimulation, people will think about their own fears. The player will transform into a victim and is on the journey to escape the murderer he is hunting. Becoming a victim will make the player feel more realistic about the fear of children who are victims of kidnapping, pedophilia so players can clearly feel the trauma of children. The game does not use a too barbaric form of play but is enough to make players nervous in the moments of running away as well as searching for information to escape the pursuer. It will be difficult for the player to know where the enemy is until it is announced that the enemy is in that range by adding red areas warning the player that it is time to hide. The game is set in a hospital, school, a strange city and a mysterious forest with sad tones to confirm that mentally unstable people can exist anywhere. Equipment items include hammers, flashlights and accompanying costumes for the character. Our team believes that putting a lot of effort into story development and psychological aspects will entertain players as well as warn about kidnapping and pedophilia. Each setting will try to have stories based on true stories, becoming an immersed part in the plot is the way we think is the best way to educate today's young generation because we believe it is Highly entertaining and has a deep message inside. </br>

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>In this modern era, people usually feel stress even a child because of the pressure of the life. They are easily lost their mind and get depressed when something is not follow what they think, and they won’t get the result as they want. That’s why people nowadays tend to choose game as an another place for them to immerse in, and release all of the stress they have at that day. For example, most of the citizens in Japan feel stress when they lose their jobs, and you will be suprised because you can see many people in those game areas are the adults. They want to liberate their mind and exit out of the reality. That’s our motivation to create this game to help people escape the depression of this life.

                                <h3>Landscape</h3>
                                <p>This is the first project we've done and the first project where we sat down together to discuss and share each other's interests so we can get along best when doing group work. Finally, because each of our members has a common interest in games, especially the horror game genre. In the Vietnamese game market, horror games are not as popular as genres combining role-playing and action. It's difficult for a horror game to satisfy the masses because this is a special genre that challenges players to overcome their fears. This type of game is also very difficult to select sound as well as has high requirements for images and graphics of the game. However, our project does not stop at simple development in the domestic game market but also competes with famous international games. 
                                    <br>For domestic market: </br>
                                    <br> Divine insect </br>
                                    <br>   The horror </br>
                                    <br>For international markets:</br> 
                                    <br>The little nightmare </br>
                                    <br>Outlast </br>
                                    <br>Home sweet home </br>
                                    <br>Dread Out </br>
                                    <br>According to research, horror games often focus on elements of intimidation and role-playing, but our game is not just that. We do not aim at the psychological fear of the killer's pursuit, but rather focus on the psychological obsessions that the victims have to go through, thereby making players gradually reflect and understand their psychology. The victims are innocent, happy children who gradually become darker in game color, expressing their psychology after being tortured by the pursuer. Players will not be alone in playing their role, but instead we will also integrate characters that for us are like measures to save the souls of children. These characters will give suggestions or sometimes healing measures and useful items for the player. Our gameplay is also somewhat special compared to other horror games of the same name, the player will transform into a child who does not have enough strength and easily loses composure in a dark space. Additionally, because they are children, we do not provide any accompanying items as weapons other than a small lantern. Players must use items on the road to make traps to prolong the time to stay away from the murderer and also have a fixed time to hide in a fixed place because if they stay too long that area will gradually lose light. The morning made the child crazy. Not only that, we also focus on audio and visual elements: </br>
                                    <br>This is a rare game that combines AR technology to help players easily interact with the characters. Just scan your house and our product can automatically set that image into the game as a new map.  
                                    Dolby Atmos technology - the leading audio technology currently installed by us in the game. This technology is often known for its use in 3D cinemas and now it will be great for players to experience that technology in their own homes. 
                                    As mentioned, the special feature of this horror game is the integration of real events, so players can develop the ability to reason and comment on each case. Each answer the player gives when asked by our supporting character will take the player to different stories and not every player will encounter the same thing. 
                                    We launched the game not only for entertainment but also for the humane purpose of reminding people to be more vigilant in everyday environments to avoid those with bad intentions, and to always be observant. children near you to avoid unfortunate events from happening. We will also constantly upgrade the game from image and sound quality and update the latest news about current problems. </br>
