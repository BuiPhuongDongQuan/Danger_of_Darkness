              <h3>Bao Ngoc's reflection</h3>
              <p>Introduction to IT has brought me new experiences, expanding my knowledge in the IT field, especially with our team's current project which is a horror game with humanistic elements. I got to try my hand at working with HTML, GitHub, JavaScript, ccs which will help me in the coming years of study and work. We are all first-term members of the IT industry, with limited experience, each member tries to help each other with aspects that other members do not understand, helping each other in the group's work. Becoming a member of the group was also a big surprise for me, because of the introverted nature of the field, but I realized that the members are very sociable, help, motivate each other in their work and sometimes We also experienced horror games together to better understand the project we are pursuing. I have learned a lot from the members, from their talent in group work, organizing work effectively and correcting mistakes in how to code, how to present reports. However, we cannot always get along so well. We still have conflicting opinions and small arguments, but thanks to that, we have come to understand each other's way of working and thinking together. 
                In short, this project gave me the opportunity to know more great teammates and expand my knowledge in many aspects including the IT field but also how to work and communicate within the team. I highly appreciate the spirit of each team member and the experience of learning about this field of game making. </p>

              <h3>Quang Nhat's reflection</h3>
              <p>First of all, I realized that working with a team is really important because everyone will have a different skills and opinions. Because of that difference, it could create the special thing and the greatful result when we know how to work together and display our thoughts for other people to understand what our purpose is. After a lot of times we tried to combine everything related to this project, I realized that I have to change my mind a lot to fit with my team. GitHub is one of the applications we used to work together most of the time. The first time we approached this app, it was so hard for us to use it such as uploading files, using “push, pull” command to update files on GitHub. Moreover, this topic idea came out because my team wanted to make something different from the other, so do I. Thus, we created develop this project as best as we can. For me, there are some flaws in this product, but I think those mistakes could be accepted because the most important thing is to inspire anyone. Finally, I really appreciate that I have a chance to cooperate with the current members of HOLY IT team, they all worked hard and usually had critical questions to improve this assignment as best as possible. </p>

                <h3>Overall reflection</h3>
                <p>The opportunity to work together on Introduction to Information Technology is very valuable to us. We learned from each other in every aspect from communication, teamwork and especially about our horror game project. Starting with limited knowledge but wanting to experience new things together, at first we may still have arguments in choosing topics, disagreements about personal opinions, but that's not the case. is an obstacle but a driving force for us to understand each other, exchange and develop personal perspectives for a common project. We do not limit ourselves to making a product related to academic fields but want to start with a project that connects us together: a game. Taking the topic of horror games as a project for this assignment was a big challenge because we had to consider the benefits it brings as well as the messages we want to convey through the game, not ust a normal entertainment game. The gaming market is one of the potential markets and will always grow because of entertainment needs.</p>
                <p> Through the project, we have the opportunity to experience together analyzing and understanding this field. The knowledge of HTML and Github introduced in the curriculum has helped us a lot in the process of working in groups and building projects. Not only that, this course in general and this project in particular are a good launching pad for us during our time studying at RMIT and developing experience in the IT field. We had a valuable experience to improve our teamwork experience, soft skills as well as exposure to programming languages and tools. The group members all chose the IT field as their goal, with certain strengths and weaknesses. Our leader has done a very good job of dividing tasks for each member and promoting group work progress. Each team member urges each other to work faster while still ensuring project quality. We highly appreciate this project and are very grateful for the opportunity to cooperate and exchange skills together. </p>
