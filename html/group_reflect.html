                        <p>Introduction to IT has brought me new experiences, expanding my knowledge in the IT field, especially with our team's current project which is a horror game with humanistic elements. I got to try my hand at working with HTML, Github, Javascript, ccs which will help me in the coming years of study and work. We are all first-term members of the IT industry, with limited experience, each member tries to help each other with aspects that other members do not understand, helping each other in the group's work. . Becoming a member of the group was also a big surprise for me, because of the introverted nature of the field, but I realized that the members are very sociable, help, motivate each other in their work and sometimes We also experienced horror games together to better understand the project we are pursuing.I have learned a lot from the members, from their talent in group work, organizing work effectively and correcting mistakes in how to code, how to present reports. However, we cannot always get along so well. We still have conflicting opinions and small arguments, but thanks to that, we have come to understand each other's way of working and thinking. together.
                            In short, this project gave me the opportunity to know more great teammates and expand my knowledge in many aspects including the IT field but also how to work and communicate within the team. I highly appreciate the spirit of each team member and the experience of learning about this field of game making.
