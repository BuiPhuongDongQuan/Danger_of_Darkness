              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Introduction to IT has brought me new experiences, expanding my knowledge in the IT field, especially with our team's current project which is a horror game with humanistic elements. I got to try my hand at working with HTML, GitHub, JavaScript, ccs which will help me in the coming years of study and work. We are all first-term members of the IT industry, with limited experience, each member tries to help each other with aspects that other members do not understand, helping each other in the group's work. Becoming a member of the group was also a big surprise for me, because of the introverted nature of the field, but I realized that the members are very sociable, help, motivate each other in their work and sometimes We also experienced horror games together to better understand the project we are pursuing. I have learned a lot from the members, from their talent in group work, organizing work effectively and correcting mistakes in how to code, how to present reports. However, we cannot always get along so well. We still have conflicting opinions and small arguments, but thanks to that, we have come to understand each other's way of working and thinking together. 
                In short, this project gave me the opportunity to know more great teammates and expand my knowledge in many aspects including the IT field but also how to work and communicate within the team. I highly appreciate the spirit of each team member and the experience of learning about this field of game making. </p>

              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">When I enrolled in RMIT, I had a fear that I couldn’t do group work, because I’m so introverted and I’m worried that people can’t fit each other because everyone has different personalities. When I first met our team, each of us was quite distant from each other and quite shy about communicating with each other. Nevertheless, after a long time working with my team, I realized that they have very good personalities. Ngoc is a person who is a very responsible person, always completing the job properly on time. Talking about Khoi, I can say that he knows how to listen to team members ‘opinions and come up with the best solution that everyone is satisfied with. Nhat is a very energetic person. When he finishes his work, he takes it upon himself to talk about more work to do. We went from being strangers to becoming a team that fits very well together. For me, meeting these friends went nicely for me. However, we aren’t quite well at managing our time. When we meet each other, we spend a lot of time communicating and relaxing. There were instances when we had to rush through certain parts of the assignment due to last-minute changes and unforeseen obstacles. One thing that surprises me is that we work with each other very smoothly. Whenever we have conflicts, we approach them with an open mind and a focus on finding common ground. This capacity for collaboration and compromise allowed us to keep a positive group dynamic. Throughout this assignment, I learned the importance of diversity within a group. Each member brought unique skills and perspectives, which enriched our discussion and ultimately led to a more comprehensive and creative solution. </p>

              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">First of all, I realized that working with a team is really important because everyone will have a different skills and opinions. Because of that difference, it could create the special thing and the greatful result when we know how to work together and display our thoughts for other people to understand what our purpose is. After a lot of times we tried to combine everything related to this project, I realized that I have to change my mind a lot to fit with my team. GitHub is one of the applications we used to work together most of the time. The first time we approached this app, it was so hard for us to use it such as uploading files, using “push, pull” command to update files on GitHub. Moreover, this topic idea came out because my team wanted to make something different from the other, so do I. Thus, we created develop this project as best as we can. For me, there are some flaws in this product, but I think those mistakes could be accepted because the most important thing is to inspire anyone. Finally, I really appreciate that I have a chance to cooperate with the current members of HOLY IT team, they all worked hard and usually had critical questions to improve this assignment as best as possible. </p>

              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">After finishing this project, I have expanded a lot about my IT knowledge and developed my coding skills. In this project, we have to be familiarized with a variety of language programs, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a website; and this is my first time utilizing it; therefore, I do not have any experience with it. I first struggled to immerse myself in these skills as I was doing my study. However, I have got great teammates that support me and others whose primary target is to reach a high score. When we form a team, I think that this group will be challenging to communicate with since virtually all of us are introverts. However, after a few meetings and hanging out together, we can get closer and understand a little more about each other. From that point forward, we can collaborate without difficulty, exchange ideas, and feel more at ease giving feedback to each other. Of course, we still had several arguments during the working process; but it was not the negative arguments, these debates have the purpose of helping the project achieve a high score. Thanks to this project, I was able to gain more knowledge about IT and improve my specialized skills as well as my soft skills; and one more important thing is that I was able to make new friends and work with a fantastic team.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The opportunity to work together on Introduction to Information Technology is very valuable to us. We learned from each other in every aspect from communication, teamwork and especially about our horror game project. Starting with limited knowledge but wanting to experience new things together, at first we may still have arguments in choosing topics, disagreements about personal opinions, but that's not the case. is an obstacle but a driving force for us to understand each other, exchange and develop personal perspectives for a common project. We do not limit ourselves to making a product related to academic fields but want to start with a project that connects us together: a game. Taking the topic of horror games as a project for this assignment was a big challenge because we had to consider the benefits it brings as well as the messages we want to convey through the game, not ust a normal entertainment game. The gaming market is one of the potential markets and will always grow because of entertainment needs.</p>
                <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Through the project, we have the opportunity to experience together analyzing and understanding this field. The knowledge of HTML and Github introduced in the curriculum has helped us a lot in the process of working in groups and building projects. Not only that, this course in general and this project in particular are a good launching pad for us during our time studying at RMIT and developing experience in the IT field. We had a valuable experience to improve our teamwork experience, soft skills as well as exposure to programming languages and tools. The group members all chose the IT field as their goal, with certain strengths and weaknesses. Our leader has done a very good job of dividing tasks for each member and promoting group work progress. Each team member urges each other to work faster while still ensuring project quality. We highly appreciate this project and are very grateful for the opportunity to cooperate and exchange skills together. </p>
